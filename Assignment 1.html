<body><h1><u> <center>Safely Surfing The Internet</u></center></h1>
<p> 
    <u><h3> With the growing popularity of the Internet, there is increased concern about children surfing the Net. The Internet offers many terrific sites and activities for kids to explore, but it also offers sites suitable only for adults. </u></h3>
</p>
<p><u> <h3>    It's important for you, as parents, to understand the opportunities and dangers available to children on the Internet so you can feel comfortable letting your child explore the on-line world. </i></h3>

<h2>THE GLOBAL NEIGHBORHOOD</h2>    
   <p><i>  <h3>   Imagine you were allowing your child and her friends to go into town or to the mall for the first time without adult chaperones. Even though you know there are dangers to your child out in the world, you wouldn't necessarily  keep her at home. You would suggest things to do you think she would enjoy, tell her how to locate places you have visited together, and warn her how to stay safe.</h3> </i></p> 
    <p><i>  <h3> In just the same way, you must teach your child how to use the Internet safely. The Internet is a diverse global community. But like any community there are both appropriate and inappropriate places for children to visit and wonderful and not-so-wonderful people for them to meet. Children need guidelines to make these distinctions.  </h3> </i></p> <br>
   <h2>OPTIONS ON THE HORIZON</h2>
    <p><b><h3>Several groups are working to create a rating system for Internet sites. Their plan is to have all site authors voluntarily rate their sites according to a rating system similar to the one used for movies, but much more specific. You could then set a type of filter software to refuse connection to "X" or "R" rated sites. One organization that is working to develop an Internet Rating Standard is Safe Surf.</h3>
